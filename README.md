# Superstore Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

---

## About the Project

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data from a Superstore to understand business performance beyond surface-level revenue numbers. The goal is to identify profit drivers, loss-making areas, and operational inefficiencies using structured data analysis.

The analysis follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow — starting from raw, unclean data and progressing through cleaning, exploration, insight generation, and business recommendations.

## Problem Statement

Despite strong overall sales, the Superstore experiences inconsistent profitability across product categories, customer segments, and regions. High discounts, operational costs, and loss-making sub-categories may be negatively impacting business performance.

The objective of this analysis is to:

* Identify areas where high sales do not translate into profit
* Understand the impact of discounts, shipping modes, and customer segments on profitability
* Provide data-driven recommendations to improve overall business performance

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains order-level sales data with information on:

* Orders and shipping details
* Customer segments
* Product categories and sub-categories
* Sales, discounts, and profit
* Regional performance

Two versions of the dataset are used:

* **Raw Dataset**: Contains inconsistent formats, and unprocessed columns
* **Cleaned Dataset**: Processed for analysis by handling correcting data types, and standardizing fields

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Google Colab** for analysis and documentation

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Sales vs Profit Analysis
4. Discount Impact Analysis
5. Category & Sub-Category Performance

## Key Insights

* High sales volume does not always result in high profitability, particularly in the Furniture category
* Certain sub-categories consistently generate losses despite frequent sales
* Discounts above a certain threshold significantly reduce profit margins
* Corporate customers contribute higher average profit compared to other segments
* Some regions and shipping modes incur higher operational costs, affecting profitability

---

## Business Recommendations

* Re-evaluate pricing and discount strategies, especially for loss-making categories
* Limit excessive discounting that leads to negative profit margins
* Focus retention and marketing efforts on high-value customer segments
* Optimize shipping modes to balance customer satisfaction and cost efficiency
* Regularly track profit alongside revenue for better decision-making
